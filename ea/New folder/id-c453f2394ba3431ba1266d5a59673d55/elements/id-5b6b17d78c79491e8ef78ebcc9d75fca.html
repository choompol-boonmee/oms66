Whereas Contract No. 2A, 2B, 2C, and 2D could be carried out independently of each other, their
common interdependencies with the work to be carried out under Contract No. 1 must be recognized. In
this respect, the Contractors responsible for the FDCU/WRL scope of work shall cooperate closely in a
comparable, compatible, and consistent way with Contractor No. 1 (the TDMS Contractor) to ensure
that the Authority&#8217;s functional, capacity, performance, and security requirements are met from an
overall project perspective. To this end:
1) All contractors (including the suppliers of the TDMS, the different FDCUs, and the different
UHF radio equipment) shall cooperate in early integration tests as part of a Joint Development
program. The aim of the program is to demonstrate the ability of the TDMS to interoperate
successfully with the FDCU and radio equipment via a common DNP 3.0 profile and thereby
minimize potential problems during subsequent on-site point-to-point testing. The proposals of
all contractors shall have described their suggested approach to the Joint Development program
to help finalize and reach agreement on a detailed and comprehensive plan for the program as
soon as possible after DDIP implementation begins.
2) Contractor No. 1 shall be responsible for helping the Authority coordinate the work of the other
contractors. This shall include taking the lead in the above referenced Joint Development
program as well as calling for meetings as may be necessary to identify and resolve common
design, test, and schedule issues. It shall also include responsibility for proposing solutions to
the technical problems that may arise during the process of integrating the FDCUs, including
the WRL radio equipment, so that they interoperate with the TDMS successfully.
