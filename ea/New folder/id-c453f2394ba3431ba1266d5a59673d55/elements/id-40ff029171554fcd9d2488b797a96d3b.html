Documentation shall be provided for all equipment and functions provided by the Contractor as part of DDIP. Unless otherwise specified in these Technical Specifications, all documentation shall be in
English and/or Thai. The documentation shall describe the TDMS, including all of its hardware, software, and interfaces and shall cover functionality, testing, installation, cutover, system startup, operations, and maintenance.
21.1 Definitions
For the purposes of this project, the following definitions shall be used:
1) Documents or Documentation &#8211; Textural and graphical information describing the TDMS or equipment, systems, and other items peripheral to the TDMS, whether embodied in hardcopy or electronic form such as common word processor files. Documents may also be referred to as manuals, guides, books, drawings, transmittals, and specifications. Documents are further divided into standard, OEM, and custom documents.
2) Standard documents &#8211; Documents produced by the Contractor that are applicable to all users of the equipment and software, including the Authority. It is expected that the Contractor will use a formal revision control scheme to maintain its standard documents. Documents not maintained under such a scheme shall be considered custom documents.
3) OEM documents &#8211; OEM (original equipment manufacturer) documents are standard documents produced by subcontractors. Documents produced by subcontractors for customized elements of the TDMS shall be deemed custom documents.
4) Custom documents &#8211; All documents not categorized as standard or OEM documents including the Contractor&#8217;s standard documents that are modified to meet the Authority&#8217;s specific requirements.
5) Project Documents &#8211; Project documents are those documents produced for the conduct of the project, but which do not directly describe the TDMS. Examples of project documents include transmittal cover pages, correspondence between the Authority, the Contractor, and other parties, electronic mail messages, records of telephone conversations, meeting minutes, action item lists, test plans and procedures, and transmittal and document lists.
The requirements for project documents are addressed in the following clauses:
1) Documentation plan &#8211; Clause 24.5.1
2) Project progress report &#8211; Clause 24.5.2
3) Project meeting, agenda, and minutes &#8211; Clause 24.5.3
4) Detailed implementation schedule &#8211; Clause 24.5.5
5) Project security documentation &#8211; Clause 24.6.1
6) Variance records &#8211; Clause 22.5.1
7) Factory test documents &#8211; Clause 22.4 and Clause 22.9
8) Site test documents &#8211; Clause 22.4 and Clause 22.10
9) Availability test documents &#8211; Clause 22.4 and Clause 22.11
10) Training documents &#8211; Clause 23.2.
The remainder of this clause addresses the requirements for documents other than project documents.
21.2 Document Format
Documents shall be delivered in two phases:
1) Approval documents submitted for Authority review and approval
2) Final documents.
In addition to accessing Contractor documents posted on the Project Tracking System (PTS) as described in Clause 24.4, the Authority prefers that documents be delivered as softcopy on magnetic media or by electronic transfer (electronic mail or ftp, for example). Final documents, as well as being posted on the PTS, shall be delivered as hardcopy and on CD-ROM.
System users with appropriate permissions shall be able to access system on-line documentation as well, i.e., documentation such as functional design documents, user guides, maintenance manuals, on-line help, and operating procedures, via a simple procedure involving a point and click operation.
Documents shall be supplied in a format that can be edited by the Authority. Handwritten texts are not acceptable. The Authority's standard word processing software is Microsoft Office. The Contractor is encouraged to use this software for documents. All documents should be searchable. If the Contractor uses other word processing or document production software, copies of the software suitable for installation on personal computers using a current WINDOWS Operating System shall be provided.
Drawings and diagrams may be embedded in the document files or may be supplied as separate files. The Authority's standard drawing software is AutoCAD. If the Contractor uses other drawing software, copies of the software suitable for installation on a personal computer using a current WINDOWS Operating System shall be provided.
Documents delivered as hardcopy shall be printed on both sides of A4 paper and bound in three-ring binders. Divider pages with appropriately labeled tabs shall separate chapters. The spine of each volume shall be labeled with the document title and volume number, so it may be easily identified when shelved.

Documents delivered on softcopy media shall be formatted for printing on A4 paper.
Each document shall include a title or information page showing the document number, title, and revision record. The document number shall be a unique number assigned in accordance with the Contractor's standard practice. The title page shall include a space into which the Authority may enter a document number assigned from the Authority's document management system. The revision record

shall describe each new version of the document since its original production. The revision record shall include:
1) The date of the change
2) A brief description of the change
3) An indication that the change has been reviewed and approved in accordance with the Contractor's quality assurance procedures
4) The version or release of the hardware or software to which the document applies.
Each document shall include a table of contents. If a document is divided into several physical volumes, each volume shall contain the complete table of contents of the whole document.

Documents that describe generic or typical TDMS elements will not be acceptable to the Authority unless the specific material applicable to this project is easily distinguishable from the material not applicable to this project. Custom documents shall not contain any material that is not pertinent to the project.
Where the phrase "on-line documentation" is used in these Technical Specifications, it shall be interpreted to mean the ability to view the document from any TDMS workstation. The Contractor shall provide all software necessary to provide this capability. For non-OEM documentation (documentation produced by the Contractor), the Contractor shall also provide the capability to edit and annotate the document.
21.3 Document Review and Approval
All standard and OEM documents provided pursuant to this contract shall be subject to review by the Authority. Custom documents pursuant to this contract shall be subject to approval by the Authority.
21.3.1 Document Review
The Authority's review of documents shall be limited to determining that:
1) The documents are legible and have been produced in accordance with the documentation standards of the Contractor or subcontractors.
2) All hardware and software is in full conformance with the contract.
3) All software has been produced in accordance with the coding and display standards of the Contractor or subcontractors.
4) The documents clearly and accurately describe the features and options of the hardware and software that pertain to the TDMS.

The Authority will review documents within ten (10) working days of their submittal. Unusual circumstances notwithstanding, if the Authority does not transmit comments on the documents within the review period, the Contractor may assume that the document is fully acceptable to the Authority.
If the Authority transmits comments on any documents, the Contractor shall respond to the comments within ten (10) working days of receipt of the comments. If the comments address OEM documents, the Contractor shall act as an advocate of the Authority to initiate and facilitate resolution of the comments with the subcontractor.
21.3.2 Document Approval
All custom and project documents shall be subject to a formal approval process. Factory and site test plans and procedures (Clauses 22.4.1 and 22.4.2) shall also be subject to approval. The review for approval performed by the Authority will be like the document review process but will more closely examine the functionality and design aspects of the hardware or software. Clarity and completeness of the presentation of the material within the documents will be a key element of the review for approval.
The approval process shall proceed as follows:
1) The Contractor shall transmit documents subject to the approval process to the Authority. The transmittal cover shall identify the document as requiring approval and shall identify the date by which the Authority should respond. The Contractor shall allow at least ten (10) working days for the Authority's reading of the document. This time may be adjusted by mutual agreement to accommodate the other activities of the Authority and the Contractor. Requests by either party to change the time shall be made within two (2) working days of receipt of the documents by the Authority.

2) The Authority shall return comments to the Contractor within the agreed time. The transmittal cover for the comments shall clearly indicate that the document is either:
a) Approved &#8211; If approved, the Contractor may proceed with the work covered by the document. No further approval action is required.
b) Approved with Comments &#8211; If approved with comments, the Contractor may proceed with the work covered by the document and the comments.
c) Not Approved &#8211; If not approved, the Contractor may proceed with the work covered by the document and the comments only at the Contractor&#8217;s own risk. No schedule or cost relief will be granted for any work undertaken prior to approval of the appropriate documents.
3) If desired by any party, the comments may be discussed to clarify the Authority's intent.
4) The Contractor shall then revise and resubmit the documents within five (5) working days after receipt of the comments from the Authority. This time may be adjusted by mutual agreement to accommodate the other activities of the Authority and the Contractor. Requests

by either party to change the time shall be made within two (2) working days of receipt of the comments by the Contractor.
5) All changes made to documents to reflect approval comments shall be clearly highlighted and the revision record shall be updated to reflect the changes. The Authority prefers the use of the change-tracking feature of the word processor used to produce the documents.
6) The review and comment process shall be repeated until the document is accepted. After the document is accepted, the Contractor shall deliver the required number of final copies free of highlighting due to the tracking of changes.
21.3.3 Scope of Reviews and Approvals
The acceptance or approval of any documents by the Authority shall not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to meet all requirements of the contract including responsibility for correction of the documents. The Contractor shall have no claim for additional costs or extensions of time because of delays due to document revisions that may be necessary for ensuring compliance with the contract.
All deliverable documentation shall be revised by the Contractor to reflect the delivered TDMS. Any modifications to the TDMS resulting from the factory and site acceptance tests shall be incorporated in this documentation. All previously submitted documents modified because of engineering changes, contract changes, or errors or omissions shall be resubmitted for review or approval as appropriate.
