As components of the TDMS Pre-Production Environment (PPE), the Contractor shall deliver early forms of the Development System (DVS) and Quality Assurance System (QAS). The early DVS shall be installed, on a temporary basis, at the SMC within 4 months of contract award. The early QAS may be delivered to the same site at the same time but, in any event, shall be delivered no later than two months after the early DVS.
Ideally, these early deliverables, supported by User Interface workstations and printers, shall support TDMS database building, display building, SRTU/FRTU point-to-point communications protocol testing, OMS and EGAT SCADA/EMS data exchange testing using ICCP (secure ICCP if supported by the OMS and EGAT systems), and report generation testing prior to delivery of all other TDMS environments including all remaining elements of the PPE. Also refer to Clause 3.1.3.
The Contractor shall be responsible for developing all TDMS databases, displays, and reports including those created, checked, and used on the early DVS and QAS systems but shall be assisted in this

activity by Authority personnel within the context of the PPE and PDE training that the Contractor is required to provide.
The early DVS shall include 2 workstations allowing 2 users to develop databases and/or displays at the same time. Databases and displays developed on the early DVS shall include those that are:
1) Basic to the Contractor&#8217;s TDMS
2) Customized to meet Authority specific requirements and preferences
3) Web-based in support of Corporate users of the TDMS
4) Based on conversion and/or modification of displays and databases used by the existing DDC1 and DDC2 systems
5) Based on the import of Authority AutoCAD as well as GIS files containing power system and land-based data sent, for example, via a Contractor-provided connection to the Corporate WAN.

The early QAS shall also include 2 workstations allowing 2 users to work on various PPE testing activities. In this respect, as a minimum, the QAS shall include:
1) Software and support tools for developing Authority required reports such as those that will be generated from data ultimately available from the Information Storage and Retrieval (IS&amp;R) function
2) The capability to test and debug interface issues with existing FDIs using a listening mode.
3) The capability to verify the databases that will support TDMS interfaces with other computer systems such as the Authority GIS and MDMS and the EGAT SCADA/EMS
4) The capability to support any necessary incremental software additions and/or updates so that, on re-location at one of the data centers, for example, it may be used to support verification of the data acquisition and processing functions of the TDMS using actual data source connections prior to full point-to-point testing during the TDMS Site Acceptance Test (SAT).
5) The capability to be used by the Contractor to pre-commission the ported database.
Ultimately, both the DVS and QAS systems shall be upgraded and transformed into their full-functioned forms and integrated on-site as components of one of the TDMS main platforms to be installed at one of the Authority&#8217;s two data centers.
