Compared to the existing DDC1/DDC2 architecture, which consists of individual SCADA/EMS/DMS
or SCADA/DMS systems at 14 Authority control centers, the required architecture for DDIP is
designed to provide a new SCADA/EMS/DMS capable of serving as a centralized common resource
for these same 14 control centers. On this basis, to access the functional capabilities and features of the
new SCADA/EMS/DMS, referred to hereafter as the Transmission and Distribution Management
System (TDMS), the dispatchers at all control centers will be provided with remote client workstations.
This avoids the need for individual SCADA/EMS/DMS or SCADA/DMS systems at the control
centers.
In Exhibit 3-1, SMC personnel notwithstanding, the SCADA/DMS at each control center receives,
processes, stores, and displays data for use by its own dispatcher and data engineering personnel. This
is based on system data communications with its own set of Field Device Interfaces (FDIs), i.e., the
FDIs located at the system&#8217;s substation and feeder sites.
In contrast, as shown in &#3612;&#3636;&#3604;&#3614;&#3621;&#3634;&#3604;! &#3652;&#3617;&#3656;&#3614;&#3610;&#3649;&#3627;&#3621;&#3656;&#3591;&#3585;&#3634;&#3619;&#3629;&#3657;&#3634;&#3591;&#3629;&#3636;&#3591;, the new architecture leads to a situation in which the
TDMS servers at two data centers communicate with the substation and feeder-located FDIs, where the
two data centers represent ICT facilities that are to be built as part of a separate Authority project. By
having TDMS servers at both data centers, the DDIP goal to provide disaster recovery capabilities are
met, i.e., if one data center&#8217;s TDMS functions are no longer available, dispatchers can continue working
by accessing the same functions executing on the TDMS servers at the alternative (backup) data center.
In addition, with all control centers having access to the same SCADA, EMS, and DMS functions, one
or more control centers can serve as backup for any control centers that become non-functional. For
example, if one control center goes down, dispatchers at other control centers can be assigned its Areas
of Responsibility (AORs). Note that critical TDMS functions at any data center will also be backed up,
i.e., these functions will be supported by redundant servers so that, if a server goes down, failover to the
backup server will take place.
