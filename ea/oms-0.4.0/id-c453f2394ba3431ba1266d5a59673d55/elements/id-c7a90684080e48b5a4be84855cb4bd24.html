						<div class="convertlinks documentation" style="white-space:pre-wrap">Currently, dispatcher responsibilities at the SMC and ADDCs are such that:
1) Dispatchers, at ADDCs provided as part of DDC1, monitor and control the HV and MV power
system networks within their specific areas of responsibility. However, as they only have
access to their local SCADA/DMS functions, they need to closely coordinate their HV
operations with SMC dispatchers, who have access to EMS functions as well as SCADA/DMS
functions.
2) Dispatchers, at ADDCs provided as part of DDC2, also monitor and control the HV and MV
power system networks within their specific areas of responsibility. In this case, they have
remote access to the EMS functions at the SMC as well, so that they can execute functions
such as the HV power flow and contingency analysis functions independently of the SMC
dispatchers.
3) SMC dispatchers can monitor MV networks and, if necessary, send controls to operate MV
network devices. They can also execute the SMC system&#8217;s DMS functions. Their primary
concern, however, lies with monitoring and controlling the HV network and, in this regard,
make use of the SMC system&#8217;s EMS functions. Other related activities include:

a) Monitoring, coordinating, and supervising ADDC dispatcher control of the HV power
system network.
b) Maintaining HV and MV load forecasts for each area as well as for the overall service
territory.
c) In response to EGAT requests to shed load, deciding how much load should be shed in
each area and then directing ADDC dispatchers to shed and ultimately restore load
accordingly.
