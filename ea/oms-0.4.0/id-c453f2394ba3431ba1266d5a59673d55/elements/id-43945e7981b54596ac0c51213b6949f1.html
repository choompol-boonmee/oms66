The Contractor shall provide the Authority with recommendations pertaining to the development of a comprehensive procedure for the restoration of TDMS core functions and its full functionality following a catastrophic failure of the TDMS software or hardware.

24.7 Testing, Shipment, and Commissioning

The transition of activities from the implementation of the TDMS in the Contractor's facilities through testing, shipment, installation, cutover, and commissioning is crucial to the success of the project. This clause sets out the sequence of these activities and expands on the responsibilities of the Authority and the Contractor for these activities.
24.7.1 Factory Test Sequence
TDMS factory tests are described in Clause 22, Quality Assurance and Testing, along with conditions for test initiation and completion.
As a minimum, these tests include a preliminary factory test, a factory test, and a stability test. They shall be executed in the following sequence:
1) Preliminary factory test (Pre-FAT) &#8211; Successful completion of Pre-FAT is a pre-requisite for factory testing. This activity shall be scheduled as necessary to maintain the overall project schedule.

2) Factory test (FAT) &#8211; FAT, including the functional, performance, and unstructured tests, shall be started no sooner than two weeks after successful completion of Pre-FAT. The factory test

schedule shall be set such that any member of the Authority's staff assigned to testing shall not be required to be at the Contractor's facility more than three consecutive weeks.
3) Stability test &#8211; The stability test shall be started immediately after successful completion of FAT.
4) Cyber security audit &#8211; The cyber security audit for the TDMS shall be performed immediately after successful completion of FAT on a non-interference basis with the stability test.

24.7.2 Authorization for Shipment

Acknowledgement of the successful completion of all factory tests related to the TDMS shall be deemed as authorization for the Contractor to ship the tested hardware and software to the Authority's site. Shipment will not be authorized until all major variances have been corrected to the Authority&#8217;s satisfaction. However, the Contractor shall submit an official notice of intent to ship at least one month prior to completion of the factory test. The notice shall indicate the contents, names of all carriers, estimated shipping weight, size of shipment, insurance provisions, date scheduled to leave the factory, and estimated date and time of arrival at the Authority's facilities.
The Authority reserves the right to delay shipment if this notice is not given by the required time. Such delay shall be completely to the account of the Contractor &#8211; no schedule or cost relief will be granted.
24.7.3 Change Control

The Contractor shall establish and document a methodical process of change control and configuration management for identification, control, and reporting of any change to the project&#8217;s software and hardware components both before and after shipment to Authority sites.
After the installation task (refer to Clause 24.7.4), all test plans, procedures, and results and any associated data shall be updated to reflect the current state of the delivered systems and equipment. The test plans and procedures shall serve as the basis for testing and verifying any changes that are implemented by the Contractor or Authority during the life of the project&#8217;s systems and equipment.
24.7.4 Installation and Cutover
After project equipment is delivered to its assigned site, and the Authority confirms that it has been received in a complete and satisfactory manner, Contractor TDMS installation and cutover activities shall commence. The Contractor&#8217;s Site Installation and Cutover Plan referenced in Clause 24.5.6 shall be followed. With Authority approval, however, allowance shall be made for any unforeseen circumstances requiring modifications to the plan.

24.7.5 Commissioning
Commissioning in the form of the Site Acceptance Test (SAT), as described in Clause 22.10, shall demonstrate that the TDMS and all equipment is ready for commercial operation. The commissioning activities shall start immediately after successful completion of system installation and cutover as described in Clause 24.7.4. These activities shall include but shall not be limited to checking that the on-site systems and equipment can provide the required functionality.
The Contractor shall be responsible for these tasks with support from the Authority where necessary. Via the site functional and performance test, the Contractor shall ensure that the TDMS is ready to meet the functional performance requirements associated with the guarantee test to be conducted by the Authority (refer to Clause 24.8).

24.8 TDMS Guarantee Test
Over and above commissioning, the TDMS shall be subject to a guarantee test. This test consists of two components as follows:
1) Functional Performance Capability &#8211; This test shall formally check the Contractor&#8217;s functional guarantees with respect to the system&#8217;s function execution times and user interface response times while running under typical operating conditions.
2) System Availability - This test shall formally check the Contractor&#8217;s functional guarantees with respect to overall system availability, i.e., from the perspective of maintaining critical TDMS functionality while running under typical operating conditions.

Further details related to these components can be found elsewhere in the Technical Specifications (i.e., Clause 15, Capacity and Performance, and Clause 22, Quality Assurance and Testing).
The guarantee test shall be started as soon as possible after Contractor commissioning activities have been completed successfully. In this respect, all known variances shall have been corrected. In addition, all other relevant prerequisites (Clause 22.6.1, Test Initiation) shall have been completed to the Authority&#8217;s satisfaction.
The Authority shall be responsible for conducting the guarantee test with support from the Contractor. It will be conducted while the TDMS is in normal day-to-day operation. During the test period, the Authority will also monitor the general behavior of the system and report any variances that may be observed. The Contractor shall correct these variances as promptly as possible as part of the Contractor&#8217;s system warranty obligations.
On satisfactory completion of the guarantee test, the Authority will issue the TDMS Provisional Acceptance Certificate (PAC).
Subsequently, at the end of the warranty period, the Authority will issue the Final Acceptance Certificate (FAC).


24.9 System Maintenance
Once it is commissioned and handed-over for commercial operation, the TDMS shall be capable of being used and maintained by the Authority without requiring continual intervention or assistance by the Contractor. Within this context, the Authority&#8217;s maintenance objective and related requirements during project implementation and during and after the TDMS warranty period are further described in the following sub-clauses.
24.9.1 Maintenance Objective
Due to the critical nature of its power system operations, the Authority&#8217;s maintenance objective is to minimize system down time, i.e., to maximize the availability of the TDMS. To achieve this objective, the following criteria shall apply:
1) Maximum use of preventive maintenance procedures to avoid unnecessary down time.
2) Use of corrective maintenance procedures that minimize repair times especially during down times.
3) Provision of comprehensive and easy-to-use diagnostic software.

4) Provision of all equipment, test instruments, and spare parts necessary and sufficient to perform preventive and corrective maintenance.
5) Provision of comprehensive well-written maintenance and troubleshooting manuals.
6) Provision of all necessary and sufficient training so that all maintenance tasks can be accomplished as effectively and efficiently as possible.

24.9.2 Scope of Authority and Contractor System Maintenance
The Contractor shall be responsible for routine preventive and corrective maintenance of all Contractor-provided hardware and software until the Authority has accepted them and until their respective warranty periods begin. Subsequently, although responsibility for routine maintenance will pass to the Authority, the Contractor shall continue to perform all repair and variance correction work that may be necessary until the end of the warranty periods.
From the beginning of the project through completion of warranty, the Contractor shall supply all of the equipment, materials, tools, accessories, and spare parts necessary and sufficient to keep all systems and equipment in full and complete working order. The Authority does not intend to purchase such maintenance related elements during this period. Other elements such as printer paper, magnetic media, and cleaning materials, as also necessary for system and equipment maintenance, shall be supplied by the Contractor until the start of warranty. In all such respects, any element (including any spare part) that is necessary for maintenance, but is not specifically mentioned in these Technical Specifications, shall be taken into account and, from the Authority&#8217;s perspective, shall be considered as included in the contract.

24.9.3 Maintenance Reports
Throughout project implementation, including the warranty period, the Contractor shall keep a maintenance log for each system in which all inspections and repairs shall be recorded. These reports shall be available to the Authority upon request. In addition, every three (3) months, the Contractor shall send a report to the Authority summarizing all maintenance activities during the past three-month period.
24.9.4 Update and Information Services
The Authority is interested in keeping the TDMS and other software updated as the Contractor and OEMs make improvements and upgrades to their products. Within this context, the Contractor shall

arrange to provide the Authority with such updates. This shall include keeping the Authority informed of all update and information services that are offered by any OEM and third-party software suppliers.
The update services shall be provided at the Contractor's expense for the duration of the respective warranty periods. After the Contractor's warranty expires, the arrangements made with the OEM and third-party software suppliers shall allow the Authority to initiate its own subscription to relevant OEM or third-party software supplier services. Likewise, on a continuing basis, the Authority shall have the option to subscribe to the update and information services offered by the Contractor.
