Users have access to the data necessary to perform their duties; therefore, data is shared across enterprise functions and organizations.
Rationale:
Timely access to accurate data is essential to improving the quality and efficiency of enterprise decision-making. It is less costly to maintain timely, accurate data in a single application, and then share it, than it is to maintain duplicative data in multiple applications. The enterprise holds a wealth of data, but it is stored in hundreds of incompatible stovepipe databases. The speed of data collection, creation, transfer, and assimilation is driven by the ability of the organization to efficiently share these islands of data across the organization.
Shared data will result in improved decisions since we will rely on fewer (ultimately one virtual) sources of more accurate and timely managed data for all of our decision-making. Electronically shared data will result in increased efficiency when existing data entities can be used, without re-keying, to create new entities.

Implications:
This is one of three closely-related principles regarding data: data is an asset; data is shared; and data is easily accessible
The implication is that there is an education task to ensure that all organizations within the enterprise understand the relationship between value of data, sharing of data, and accessibility to data.

To enable data sharing we must develop and abide by a common set of policies, procedures, and standards governing data management and access for both the short and the long term
For the short term, to preserve our significant investment in legacy systems, we must invest in software capable of migrating legacy system data into a shared data environment
We will also need to develop standard data models, data elements, and other metadata that defines this shared environment and develop a repository system for storing this metadata to make it accessible
For the long term, as legacy systems are replaced, we must adopt and enforce common data access policies and guidelines for new application developers to ensure that data in new applications remains available to the shared environment and that data in the shared environment can continue to be used by the new applications
For both the short term and the long term we must adopt common methods and tools for creating, maintaining, and accessing the data shared across the enterprise
Data sharing will require a significant cultural change
This principle of data sharing will continually "bump up against" the principle of data security - under no circumstances will the data sharing principle cause confidential data to be compromised
Data made available for sharing will have to be relied upon by all users to execute their respective tasks
This will ensure that only the most accurate and timely data is relied upon for decision-making. Shared data will become the enterprise-wide "virtual single source" of data.
