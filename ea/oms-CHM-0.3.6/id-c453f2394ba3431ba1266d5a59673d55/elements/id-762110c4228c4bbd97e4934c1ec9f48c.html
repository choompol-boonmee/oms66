The TDMS shall include HV/MV power system applications that can be used in real-time, study, and simulation modes to support power system operations, planning, and training. This clause of the Technical Specifications presents the minimum functional requirements associated with these applications.
The Dispatcher shall use the Contractor-provided applications executing on the TDMS data center servers to monitor and control both the HV and MV elements of the Authority&#8217;s power system network within the Dispatcher&#8217;s assigned AORs. To the extent possible, the requirements herein shall be met by the Contractor&#8217;s standard (off-the-shelf) EMS/DMS applications and, in this respect, the Contractor&#8217;s proposal shall have identified which of the Authority&#8217;s requirements, if any, are not met by these standard applications. The Contractor&#8217;s proposal shall have also identified any applications and/or any
capabilities and features (over and above those specified) that may come with the Contractor&#8217;s standard EMS/DMS applications as already built-in and available for Authority utilization or activation at no additional cost. In addition, the proposal shall have identified if any such applications may be purchased as options.
20.1 Design Features
It is recognized that EMS and DMS applications have traditionally been designed and executed separately because of the different characteristics of the EHV/HV and MV power system networks to which they relate.
For example, EMS applications relate to EHV/HV power system networks that are generally meshed and typically treated as balanced three-phase networks, whereas DMS applications relate to MV power system networks that are generally open-loop (i.e., radial) and correctly treated as unbalanced three-phase networks that may also include two-phase and single-phase circuits.
