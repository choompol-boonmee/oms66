The scope of work for DDIP concerns three (3) main components as follows:
1) Procurement, development, testing, delivery, installation, and commissioning of new SCADA,
EMS, and DMS hardware and software in the form of the Transmission and Distribution
Management System (TDMS). This includes the TDMS servers to be located at the
Authority&#8217;s two new data centers, remote workstations to be located at the 14 control centers,
new video walls at the six (6) DDC1 control centers, and all other hardware, software,
deliverables, and services to meet the Authority requirements as described in Technical
Specifications, Part B: TDMS Replacement of Existing Systems.
2) Procurement, development, testing, delivery, installation, and commissioning of Field Device
Interfaces (FDIs) in the form of numerous Field Device Control Units (FDCUs) for existing
pole-top located Remote-Control Switches (RCSs). This includes all other hardware, software,
deliverables, and services to meet the Authority requirements as described in Technical
Specifications, Part B: Field Device Interfaces.
3) Procurement, development, testing, delivery, installation, and commissioning of UHF radio
equipment in the form of numerous master/remote radio cells supporting TDMS
communications with not only the FDCUs, as referenced above, but also the existing FDIs that
serve as FRTUs for pole-top located Line Reclosers (LRCs) and Line Recloser/Regulators
(LRRs). This includes all other hardware, software, deliverables, and services to meet the
Authority requirements as described in Technical Specifications, Part C: Wireless
Communications System.</div>
