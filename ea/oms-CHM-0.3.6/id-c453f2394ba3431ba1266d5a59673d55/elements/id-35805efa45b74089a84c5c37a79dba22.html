6) Dedicated high-speed interconnections shall provide for efficient transfer of data to the system&#8217;s Storage Area Network (SAN) and/or Network Attached Storage (NAS) infrastructure. These interconnections may be dedicated paths using Fiber Distributed Data
Interface (FDDI) technology for example or may be implemented on network paths shared with other servers and processors. All such interconnections shall comply with applicable international standards.
7) Server/processor auxiliary memory (NVMe preferred), including any RAID SSD units, shall be configured with a &#8220;hot-swap&#8221; maintenance capability. A hot spare SSD shall be included within any logical group of SSDs.
8) The servers/processors shall have warning lights that indicate and help identify equipment component or subsystem faults.
9) Redundant processors shall be housed in separate rack mount enclosures to enhance NSPOF capability.
10) Servers/processors equipped with dual Network Interface Cards (NICs) shall be configured so that their functionality shall be maintained if either or both NICs are connected to the network.
17.3 Front-End Processors
Front-End Processors (FEPs) shall be dedicated to TDMS data communications with all Field Device Interfaces (FDIs) except for FDIs co-located with Switched Capacitor Banks (SCBs) and other devices dependent, for example, on third-party cellular communication facilities.
The FEPs shall check for and report protocol and other communication errors and convert the communications protocol to a common internal format compatible with the data processing functions of the TDMS. In this way, the FEPs can process the received data, in whole or in part, and store the processed data into the TDMS database or pass the data on to other TDMS resources for further processing (e.g., alarm annunciation) and storage into the database. To protect the security perimeter associated with the SCADA functionality of the TDMS, the FEPs may also serve as firewalls.
It shall be possible for maintenance engineers to monitor the performance of each communications circuit or channel, to enable and disable ports, and to switch to standby ports. Communications performance statistics shall be collected and presented in a form designed to facilitate the identification of the communication circuits or channels that suffer from high error rates.

17.4 Communication Network Processors
Communication Network Processors (CNPs) shall be dedicated to data exchange with external computer systems, such as EGAT&#8217;s EMS and the Authority&#8217;s future MDMS, and with network access nodes, such as those of local data communication service providers in support of TDMS communications with SCB Interfaces. All CNPs shall be from the same model family, use the same Operating System, and use commercially available hardware for their communication channel interfaces. To maintain system security and prevent any unwanted CNP data traffic, firewalls shall be used.

17.5 Backup and Archive Storage

17.6 Local and Wide Area Networks
The Contractor shall be responsible for implementing all necessary LANs at each data center and control center. This includes provision of all associated equipment allowing the TDMS at each center to connect with the Authority&#8217;s Corporate WAN facilities, such as the optical fiber backbone communications system. It also includes all equipment and devices that will be needed to interface the
TDMS with the high-speed data links that the Contractor is responsible for setting up via others to provide TDMS access to the required cellular networks of local service providers.
17.6.1 TDMS LANs
Each data center and control center LAN shall be redundant in configuration and, as preferred by the Authority, shall be based on 10G Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) technology. The Contractor shall provide all necessary firewalls, routers, network switches, etc. LAN cabling shall also be 10G compatible.
Each LAN comprising the redundant LAN shall be implemented with separate hardware, including chassis and power supply. Where modular network hardware is supplied, the circuit boards shall be &#8220;hot&#8221; swappable, such that it is not necessary to power down the entire chassis to replace a single card. The network design shall provide dedicated bandwidth for each LAN segment (switched technology) and facilitate the addition of future LAN segments.
The malfunction of any piece of equipment connected to a LAN shall not disrupt LAN operations. Similarly, on/off powering or connection/removal of equipment shall not be disruptive.

17.6.2 TDMS WAN
To create the TDMS WAN, the Contractor shall connect the TDMS LANs to the Corporate WAN, i.e., the Authority&#8217;s optical fiber backbone communications system. This shall include all necessary firewalls, routing switches, and cabling. Communications shall be IP-based.
17.7 Firewalls
17.7.1 General
The Contractor shall provide dedicated and redundant hardware modules for firewalls along with all supporting network equipment including routers and network switches. Where the network design has cascaded firewalls, the Contractor shall utilize firewalls that are from different vendors to maximize security. Moreover, the hardware used for firewalls shall be different depending on the specific type of interface, data traffic, and points of access being monitored and controlled from a TDMS security perspective. For example, the hardware used for the DMZE firewalls shall be different from the hardware used for security monitoring and control of the data traffic between the TDMS and its FDIs, where performance requirements are also critical.
Within this context, centralized security management software is also required. This Contractor software shall control system security related to all network equipment as well as TDMS servers and devices. Supported by log servers, the software shall include log analysis, report generation, and other security related functions as necessary to prevent, detect, and mitigate security attacks.
All firewalls shall support the necessary throughput and redundancy to meet overall system performance requirements. The number of ports provided shall have fifty (50) percent spare for usage by the Authority in the future.
They shall gracefully and automatically re-establish required connections as needed and in compliance with secure connection establishment procedures.
The Contractor shall supply a list detailing the interface ports and services required for full and secure TDMS functionality. This list shall include all information required to define the firewall rules including direction, protocol, interface port number, and associated service for each network connection.
17.7.2 Next Generation Firewalls
The firewalls shall be of next generation type using advanced security and control capabilities at throughput speeds that will allow authenticated users, computers, and applications to access TDMS services with no perceivable delays. In this respect, each Next Generation Firewall (NGFW) shall include the following features:

1) Highly effective security backed by extensive threat intelligence to reduce the risk of a data breach.
2) Integrated Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), Web filtering, reputation due to detection of suspicious activity originating from an IP address (such as spam or virus), and other advanced threat protection as may be available.
3) Deep inspection of network traffic to identify applications, users, devices, and threats through granular policy controls.
4) Single Operating System and consolidated user interface for all security and networking capabilities.
5) Centralized &#8220;single-pane-of-glass&#8221; management and reporting capabilities to visualize the NGFW&#8217;s security effectiveness and help determine what strategic security policies to implement, such visibility making it easier to control device configurations, security policies, firmware installations, and content security updates as well as monitor what is happening in the network through logging, in-depth reporting, and event management.
6) Highly reliable core firewall capabilities such as:
a) Authentication &#8211; Enforcement of user and application password construction rules such as minimum length, inclusion of non-alphanumeric characters, and maximum validity period.
b) Access Control &#8211; Different TDMS/firewall access levels for internal and external users (both persons and applications) including none, read only, read/write, and execute. Internal TDMS users shall be denied access to the Internet.

c) IP Spoofing &#8211; Protection against attacks in which a would-be intruder outside the firewall configures its machine with IP addresses on the internal TDMS LANs.
d) Prevention of Denial of Service &#8211; Protection against attacks that are characterized by attempts to deny service through overrunning buffers, filling the firewall disk, or overrunning log files, such attacks resulting in rejection of packets where they can be recognized or, where they are not recognized, resulting in shutting down or denying external access when overruns occur rather than continuing to operate with partial capability.
e) Packet Filtering Restriction &#8211; Based on both source and destination IP addresses.
f) Stateful Inspection &#8211; Determining which port numbers are used by which connections and, when a connection closes, shutting down access to the port used by the connection until another authorized user establishes a new connection.
g) Proxy Servers &#8211; Application proxies including HTTP, FTP, UDP, TCP, and others as needed for the relevant TDMS functions, access to these services being customizable based on user ID and IP address.
h) Network Address Translation (NAT) &#8211; Permitting the Authority to hide the IP addresses used on the internal TDMS LAN from external view.
i) Notifications &#8211; Recording all break-in attempts in a log file.
17.7.3 Firewall Configuration
The Contractor shall be responsible for the configuration of firewalls with Authority assistance to define the access rules. The Authority expects the following general access rules to be implemented:
1) Remote control of the power system from external points of access shall only be allowed by properly authorized personnel at the TDMS control centers.
2) Access from the TDMS to systems and networks on the Corporate WAN shall be allowed. This shall not include access to the Internet.
3) Access to the TDMS from users and systems on the Corporate WAN shall be limited by IP address and user (or account) name.
4) Corporate users at selected nodes (IP addresses) shall be permitted access to the IS&amp;R function as replicated in the DMZE for read-only purposes. The IS&amp;R access control facilities as installed in the DMZE shall be used to further limit access.
5) Corporate users at selected nodes shall be permitted access to the Web services to be installed in the DMZE.
17.8 Field Device Interface Communications
17.9 Time and Frequency Support
As noted elsewhere in these Technical Specifications, the Authority will have a time and frequency facility at each data center for use as a common resource. In particular, this facility will provide Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) obtained from the satellite constellation comprising the Global Positioning System (GPS). In this respect, it can be assumed that the time receiver will provide an overall accuracy of &#177;40 ns (&#177;150 ns peak) when tracking satellites and shall include an offset to permit correction to local time.
17.10 Remote Workstations
Dispatcher/Supervisor and data engineering workstations, as remote clients, shall include all hardware and software necessary to facilitate optimum user communications with the servers comprising the TDMS at each data center.

17.15 Printers

17.16 Data Acquisition Simulators
In addition to the hardware and software supporting the TDMS architecture, the Contractor shall provide portable Data Acquisition (DAC) simulators to be used as field device interface test sets.
These simulators, in essence, shall provide the same SCADA functionality as the TDMS so that, by connecting locally to the communication ports of an individual field device interface (i.e., at the site
where the interface is located), they can be used to verify that the field device interface data and control points are properly mapped from a TDMS database perspective and, in this respect, can be exercised and shown to be fully operational as though they were being exercised from the TDMS itself.

17.17 Spare Parts
The Contractor&#8217;s proposal shall have included a recommended list of spare parts for maintenance and repair of the equipment to be delivered as part of the TDMS scope of supply. The recommended list shall be sufficient to cover a two-year period corresponding to the total quantity of TDMS equipment to be delivered. The availability of these parts shall be guaranteed for a period of no less than ten (10) years from the date of the latest delivery of the TDMS equipment or assemblies containing these parts.
