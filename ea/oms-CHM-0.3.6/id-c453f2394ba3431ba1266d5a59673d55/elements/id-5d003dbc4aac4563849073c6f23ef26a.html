Data is protected from unauthorized use and disclosure. In addition to the traditional aspects of national security classification, this includes, but is not limited to, protection of pre-decisional, sensitive, source selection-sensitive, and proprietary information.
Rationale:
Open sharing of information and the release of information via relevant legislation must be balanced against the need to restrict the availability of classified, proprietary, and sensitive information.
Existing laws and regulations require the safeguarding of national security and the privacy of data, while permitting free and open access. Pre-decisional (work-in-progress, not yet authorized for release) information must be protected to avoid unwarranted speculation, misinterpretation, and inappropriate use.

Implications:
Aggregation of data, both classified and not, will create a large target requiring review and de-classification procedures to maintain appropriate control
Data owners and/or functional users must determine whether the aggregation results in an increased classification level. Appropriate policy and procedures will be needed to handle this review and de-classification. Access to information based on a need-to-know policy will force regular reviews of the body of information.

The current practice of having separate systems to contain different classifications needs to be rethought
Is there a software solution to separating classified and unclassified data? The current hardware solution is unwieldy, inefficient, and costly. It is more expensive to manage unclassified data on a classified system. Currently, the only way to combine the two is to place the unclassified data on the classified system, where it must remain.

In order to adequately provide access to open information while maintaining secure information, security needs must be identified and developed at the data level, not the application level
Data security safeguards can be put in place to restrict access to "view only" or "never see"
Sensitivity labeling for access to pre-decisional, decisional, classified, sensitive, or proprietary information must be determined.

Security must be designed into data elements from the beginning; it cannot be added later
Systems, data, and technologies must be protected from unauthorized access and manipulation. Headquarters information must be safeguarded against inadvertent or unauthorized alteration, sabotage, disaster, or disclosure.

New policies are needed on managing duration of protection for pre-decisional information and other works-in-progress, in consideration of content freshness
