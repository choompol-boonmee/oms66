						<div class="convertlinks documentation" style="white-space:pre-wrap">As already stated, the main objective of the Distribution Dispatching Center Improvement Project
(DDIP) is to enhance the ability of the Authority to supply electric power to customers throughout its
service territory reliably, safely, and economically. Improvement is based on:
1) Replacement of all DDC1 systems because they have become difficult and costly to maintain
and are largely obsolete.
2) Replacement of all DDC2 systems, not because they are obsolete, but to take the opportunity
to provide upgraded facilities in alignment with the more functional architecture that the new
DDC1 and DDC2 systems will support.
Within this context, some key project goals include:
1) Provision of a disaster recovery/control center backup capability, which currently is not
supported.
2) Deployment of more powerful physical servers that allow the benefits of virtual machine
technology to be realized.
3) Deployment of enhanced cyber security measures based on latest security standards and
practices.
4) Replacement of systems and no-longer viable RCS field device interfaces such that the
benefits of using Ethernet/IP rather than serial data communications can also be realized.
5) Deployment of new RCS field device interfaces in existing or new RCS control cabinets, these
new field device interfaces in the form of a Field Device Control Unit (FDCU) will provide
integrated FRTU/RCS controller functionality.
6) Utilization of DNP 3.0 (Secure Authentication) over IP as the data communications protocol in
place of the presently utilized DNP 3.0 profile, which does not include secure authentication
and is used for serial communications.
7) Future proofing such that the new RCS field device interfaces can also support IEC 61850.
8) Enhanced system integration support via capabilities and features allowing the DDIP systems
to interface with Authority GIS, OMS, MDMS, AMS, and substation CCTV systems via an
enterprise service bus utilizing standards such as the Common Information Model (CIM).
9) Enhanced support for external users on the Authority&#8217;s Corporate WAN, including field crew
use of mobile devices such as tablets and smart phones.
10) Replacement of the existing MARS networks by UHF radio equipment comprising modern
WRL networks supporting higher data rates, Ethernet/IP communications, and necessary
security features.
11) Replacement of DDC1 video display walls to take advantage of the latest technology
available.
12) Installation of Terminal Servers to convert existing CSCS and SRTU connections to the
Authority&#8217;s OFB network from Serial to Ethernet, thereby supporting IP-based
communications with the TDMS.
