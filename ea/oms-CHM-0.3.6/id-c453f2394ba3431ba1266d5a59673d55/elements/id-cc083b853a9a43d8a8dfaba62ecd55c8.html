The Contractor shall prepare and deliver a comprehensive training program on the operation and maintenance of the TDMS. This shall include hands-on training associated with Authority use of the Development System in its early deliverable configuration (refer to Clause 13).
Software training shall teach the Authority the skills required for TDMS maintenance and expansion and for the preparation and integration of new functions. This training shall cover the theory of design and operation, use, maintenance, and installation of upgrades or new releases of these software products.
Hardware training shall qualify the Authority to perform routine preventive maintenance and perform diagnostic tests on the processors and their peripheral equipment including firewalls, routers, video walls, and communications equipment.
23.1 General
23.1.1 Course Styles
The Authority prefers classroom style courses for all training. Self-study training using books, computer-aided instruction (CAI), or computer-based training (CBT) may be used as supplementary training only. A copy of any video cassette, CAI program, or CBT program used in training shall be provided to the Authority as part of the training documents.
23.1.2 Recording of Courses
The Authority shall be permitted to make video and audio recordings of all training classes. The Authority will use these recordings solely for internal instruction purposes and will not release the recordings to third parties.

23.2 Training Documents
The Contractor shall prepare a training plan in cooperation with the Authority. The Contractor shall also be responsible for the preparation and production of all course material. Training documents shall be subject to the review and approval process of Clause 21.3, Documentation Review and Approval.
23.2.1 Training Plan
The training plan shall support the TDMS implementation schedule. A logical sequence of courses shall be arranged, so that training on base system elements (such as the hardware platform, Operating System, languages, database, and displays) is given before the training for specific TDMS elements such as applications. The training program shall consider the knowledge required by members of the Authority's project team in order to participate in the project.

The training plan shall list each course to be taken, the dates for the course, and the expected number of trainees to attend. The plan shall reference the course description documents described below.
Training shall be scheduled to minimize the loss of knowledge through lack of use, i.e., training shall be scheduled so that there will not be long periods of time between training and use of the training.
It is the Authority's preference that all training, except for Dispatcher Training, be completed prior to the start of factory acceptance testing.
23.2.2 Course Descriptions
Course descriptions shall be included with the training plan to provide the following information for each course included in the training plan:
1) The course name (and number if applicable)
2) A brief description of the course
3) A description of the intended audience for the course

4) A description of the relation of the course to others in the training plan
5) The duration of the course
6) A breakdown of the course schedule, identifying classroom, laboratory, and hands-on periods
7) A list of the training materials to be supplied
8) A list of reference material to be used in the course
9) A list of any prerequisite training or experience expected of the trainees.
At the Authority's request, the Contractor shall provide a description of all courses offered by the Contractor and its subcontractors.
23.2.3 Course Material

The Contractor shall provide all necessary training materials including course manuals and reference materials. Each trainee shall receive individual copies of the training materials. Additional sets shall be provided, one for the Authority's archives at headquarters and one for each of the project&#8217;s control centers. Class materials, including documents sent before the training classes and class handouts, shall become the property of the Authority.
The Authority prefers that all course material be transmitted to the trainees at least two weeks prior to the course.

23.3 Instructor Qualifications
Course instructors shall have demonstrated technical competence in the subject and previous instructing experience. The Authority prefers instructors who specialize in course presentation as opposed to hardware or software developers who only occasionally present courses. However, for TDMS elements produced specifically for this Contract, the Contractor may use the developer as the instructor. The developer shall use appropriate training staff as resources when developing the training course and materials.
Where practical, subcontractors shall deliver training on their products directly. However, the Contractor shall remain responsible for selecting these courses, coordinating their delivery, and ensuring that all training objectives are met.

In addition to the above, if the course instructor is not proficient in the Thai language, the Authority would prefer that the Contractor also provide an interpreter, with relevant technical background, to help the instructor deliver his presentation as efficiently and effectively as possible.
23.4 Training Curriculum
The training curriculum presented in this clause is intended to describe the contents of the training when viewed in its entirety. The subjects covered by individual courses may differ if the overall objectives are satisfied.
